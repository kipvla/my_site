What was behind these new possibilities, and\n          why hadn’t he been introduced earlier? Through years, often grueling,\n          of self-discovery and exploration, Kip has combined a successful\n          career as a professional musician, performing with the Chicago, St.\n          Louis, and New World symphonies, performing in places from Cuba and El\n          Salvador to Carnegie Hall, and alongside such musicians as Yo-Yo Ma\n          and Tabea Zimmerman. as he has continued to live out these ideas of\n          accountability and helping others.\n        </p>\n\n        <a\n          class=\"mb-3\"\n          href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2017/6/11/18378502/yo-yo-ma-performs-concert-for-peace-at-st-sabina-church\">Performance\n          with Yo-Yo Ma</a>\n\n        <p in:fade=\"{{ duration: 2000 }}\">\n          As a fellow at the Civic Orchestra of Chicago and New World Symphony,\n          he designed and led several initiatives aimed at inspiring these\n          ideals of accountability and companionship in himself and amongst his\n          colleagues. In Chicago, he earned support for The Rediscovering\n          Musician, a project bringing Alexander Technique to the Civic\n          Orchestra in the form of a series of lessons for two of his colleagues\n          from teacher Lisa DeAngelis, as well as a group class and blog.\n        </p>\n\n        <a\n          class=\"mb-3\"\n          href=\"https://rediscoveringmusician.wordpress.com/\">Rediscovering\n          Musician</a>\n\n        <p in:fade=\"{{ duration: 2000 }}\">\n          In Miami, Kip designed and led Farm to Stage, a project solidifying\n          the New World Symphony’s relationship with its community in Miami, in\n          Kip’s home state of Florida, in which he partnered with the Farmworker\n          Association of Florida to connect the migrant farmworkers with the\n          symphony through concerts in Miami Beach and Homestead. He also\n          designed and led, with the help of 16 other New World fellows, Damas y\n          Caballeros, a project to further strengthen the ties of New World\n          Symphony with its community.
